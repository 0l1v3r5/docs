# Orator ORM

# Introduction

The Orator ORM is an Active Record style ORM that is truly a pleasure to work with. Because Masonite strives on separating migrations and models, an Active Record style ORM is a perfect fit. If you have used PHP's Eloquent ORM then Orator will look remarkably similar. 

Documentation will eventually be migrated to here but for now, you can read the documentation for the [Orator ORM here.](https://orator-orm.com).
