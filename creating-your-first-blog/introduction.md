## Getting Started

We will be walking through step by step and go into great detail on each part we will be building.

Our application will consist of a blog that can create, read, update and delete posts. It will be very basic and won't have much styling. This is so you can get the basics down on the framwork without too much HTML boilerplate code.

This tutorial will assume you have already installed Masonite. If you haven't, be sure to read the [Installation](../prologue/introduction-and-installaton.md) guide to get a fresh install of Masonite up and running. Once you have one up and running or if you already have it running, go ahead and start at [Part 1 of the tutorial](untitled.md).
