# Release Cycle

# Introduction

The Masonite framework itself follows the RomVer versioning schema which is HUMAN.MAJOR.MINOR although all Masonite packages follow the SemVer versioning schema which is MAJOR.MINOR.FEATURE/BUGFIX.

This means that a framework version of 1.3.20 will have breaking changes with version 1.4.0.

## Cycle

Masonite is currently on a 1 month major release cycle. This means that on the first of every month will be a new 1.x release. This 1 month release cycle will continue until Masonite has reached a release that is stable enough to move far into the future with that releases architecture.

Once this stable release has been achieved, Masonite will move to a 6 month major release cycle with minor releases as often as every few days to as much as every few months.
